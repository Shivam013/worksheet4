I think that there will be a significant difference between the mean helpfulness value of a customer and of a product.

The helpfulness score is not on a range, it is just the amount of helpful votes a customer or product is given.

The average rating on a product will be more accurate than the average rating for a customer as a product has much more reviews than a customer.
