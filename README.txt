I think that there will be a significant difference between the mean helpfulness value of a customer and of a product.

I think this is partly because a customer will usually have much less reviews written than a product has reviews written about it. 
For example: I might review 5 phones, but those 5 phones will have MANY MORE people that have reviewed it as well.

From this you can determine that the mean helpfulness score of a product is much more reliable than that of a customer because there is a bigger dataset.

As a result of the customers having less reviews, a good/bad helpfulness score will affect the customers mean by a lot more than it would the product.

For this reason, I can see there being a difference in the means as 1 score can drastically impact a customer more than it would a product.
